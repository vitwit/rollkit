To build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit.git
cd rollkit 
go build -v ./...
```

## Building With Rollkit

While Rollkit is a modular framework that aims to be compatible with a wide
range of data availability layers, settlement layers, and execution
environments, the most supported development environment is building on Celestia
as a data availability layer.

### Building On Celestia

There are currently 2 ways to build on Celestia:

1. Using a local development environment with [local-celestia-devnet](https://github.com/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet)
1. Using the Arabica or Mocha Celestia testnet
